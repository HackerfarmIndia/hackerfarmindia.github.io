      <description>HackerFarm is a residential environment, promoting radical inclusion and self reliance. People can join any camp/program and engage in building meaningful social projects and collaborate with like-minded people.
Introduction We belive that the Internet can help people in learning and making money on its sphere. While it takes care of your information repositories, we support this idea &amp;ndash; with a physcial ecosystem on a rural-themed space like farm. Participants shape their life habits around a healthy routine and maintain social touch with peer community offline and online.</description>
