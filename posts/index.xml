      <description>At HackerFarm, one can participate by choosing one of the offered Study Groups or create one if there are more than two people interested in that study/learning track. The community also helps in choosing one if that&amp;rsquo;s needed.
1. Study Groups Participants can form a study group around their interest and can organize activities. In addition to it, they can also lead for doing workshops and have remote mentorships.
Study Groups are largely unstructured until the participants form a group.</description>

      <description>HackerFarm is a residential environment, promoting radical inclusion and self reliance. People can join any camp/program and engage in building meaningful social projects and collaborate with like-minded people.
Introduction We belive that the Internet can help people in learning and making money on its sphere. While it takes care of your information repositories, we support this idea &amp;ndash; with a physcial ecosystem on a rural-themed space like farm. Participants shape their life habits around a healthy routine and maintain social touch with peer community offline and online.</description>
