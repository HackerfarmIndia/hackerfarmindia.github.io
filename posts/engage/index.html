<p>Study Groups are largely unstructured until the participants form a group. While there is no concrete goal for a study group, it is important to post and talk about weekly updates with the community and through blogs/tweets/articles writing.</p>
<p>People can take online classes or join any MOOC like <a href="http://freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a>, Udacity, Udemy to learn their programming skills. Or they can attend any online coding bootcamp from HackerFarm.</p>
<h2 id="2-digital-nomads-working-professional-residency">2. Digital Nomads/ Working Professional Residency</h2>
<p>The space welcomes people working in a remote job/work or are a digital nomad or are at early stage of building their next big thing.
With a coliving and coworking space, it becomes easy to engage in work from this distract-free environment. There is always a fresh feeling the moment you lift eyes to look deep into nature.</p>
<h2 id="3-open-to-all">3. Open to All</h2>
<p>Above all, HackerFarm camp locations allows people from any background to come and immerse themselves in a community living and skill building.</p>
