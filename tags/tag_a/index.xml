      <description>At HackerFarm, one can participate by choosing one of the offered Study Groups or create one if there are more than two people interested in that study/learning track. The community also helps in choosing one if that&amp;rsquo;s needed.
1. Study Groups Participants can form a study group around their interest and can organize activities. In addition to it, they can also lead for doing workshops and have remote mentorships.
Study Groups are largely unstructured until the participants form a group.</description>
